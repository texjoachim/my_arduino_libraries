# Little Helpers

These are the libraries I use in my projects. Nothing special, just:

* flyingFishHelper - for moisture and rain sensors
* rgbLED - for common cathode RGB LEDs
* led - for normal LEDs
* ultrasonic.h - for ultrasonic sensors
* ky033.h - for those line-following sensors
* motor.h - to control DC motors

It's easier to have them in one place when I want/need to change them.
